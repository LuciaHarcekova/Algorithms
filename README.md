# Algorithms
Complete resources to practice problems solving and prepare for coding interviews. This repo shows my solutions in C\# and Python for real interview questions taken from different sites (the origin link to the question is always in the description).
Currently, we have a few completed solutions focused on Array, String, Linked List, Stack, Queue, and other data structures.
