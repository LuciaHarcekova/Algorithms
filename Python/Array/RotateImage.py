48. Rotate Image
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate
the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify
the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
